<h1>On the Death Penalty System</h1>
<article> The death penalty should be eliminated because life is precious to everyone. No one can judge a man, and there is no right to harm his life. Only God can determine human life. As Jesus in the Bible said, "Let the innocent among you first stone the infidel's woman to death," we should not judge other people's sins because we all have sinned, nor should we kill them recklessly. However, I think heavy punishment is necessary to reduce violent crimes.</article>
