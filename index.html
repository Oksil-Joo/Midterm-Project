<h1>On the Death Penalty System</h1>
<article> The death penalty should be eliminated because life is precious to everyone. No one can judge a man, and there is no right to harm his life. Only God can determine human life. As Jesus in the Bible said, "Let the innocent among you first stone the infidel's woman to death," we should not judge other people's sins because we all have sinned, nor should we kill them recklessly. However, I think heavy punishment is necessary to reduce violent crimes.</article>

<article> Canada also abolished the death penalty from the criminal code in 1976. The death penalty was legally abolished when the National Defense Act of 1998 abolished the death penalty for military crimes. Since then, criminal statistics have shown that crimes caused by the abolition of the death penalty have not been maligned. It is said that the House of Representatives concluded in 1987 that it would not discuss the issue again, although there was still a debate over the serial killer and so on.</article>
